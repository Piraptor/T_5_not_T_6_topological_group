Let $0 \in X$ denote the neutral element.
Suppose $\{0\} = \bigcap\limits_{n=0}^{+\infty} U_n$ where $U_n$ are open.
Without loss of generality we may assume $U_n = (a_n, b_n)$ for some $a_n, b_n \in X$.
Let $\alpha_n = \min \{ \alpha \in \omega_1 : a_n(\alpha) < 0\}$ 
denote the smallest index for which $a_n$ is negative (equivalently: non-zero).
Then $\omega_1 = \bigcup\limits_{n=0}^{+\infty} \alpha_n$, which is a contradiction. 

To see this, consider a function $f \in X$, which is equal to $0$ everywhere
execpt for some $\alpha < \omega_1$ where $f$ is equal to $-1$.
Of course $f < 0$ and by assumption $f \notin U_n$ for some $n$ thus $f < a_n$. 
Then $\alpha <= \alpha_n$ which finishes the proof.
