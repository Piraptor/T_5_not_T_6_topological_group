Continuity of inverses is obvious.

Let $f + g \in (a,b)$. We need to find a neghobourhood U of $(f,g) \in G \times G$
whose image by addition is contained in $(a,b)$.

The order on G agrees with addition so $0 \in (a-f-g, b-f-g)$.
We may find $c \in G$ such that 
$a-f-g \leq -2c < 0 < 2c \leq b-f-g$
and then $a \leq f+g-2c$ and $f+g+2c \leq b$.

Indeed, if
\alpha_0 = maks \{ \alpha_1, \alpha_2 \} where 
\alpha_1 = min \{ alpha \in \omega_1 : (a-f-g)(\alpha) < 0 \} and 
\alpha_2 = min \{ alpha \in \omega_1 : 0 < (b-f-g)(\alpha) \}
then we may define $c$ to be equal to 0 for $\alpha \leq \alpha_0$ and 1 otherwise.
It's easy to see it possesses desidered properties. 
Then the neighbourhood of (f,g) we're looking for is $(f-c, f+c) \times (g-c, g+c)$.
